# Preparing ios Development Environment

In a far far age, I had a lot of interest on learning and developing iOS
applications. At that moment I tried even the VIPER patter to build that
applications and provide testing and automation based on the current existing
tools.

Today, I decided to gather all that knowledge, and create a template repository
that I could use at any moment for a quick iOS developing. Keep quality
standards take time, and that my intention with that template, accelerate the
development on iOS keeping quality standards.

- [ ] Installing required tools.
- [ ] Defining directory structure.
- [ ] Add automation.
  - [ ] local
  - [ ] github workflow
- [ ] Add developer documentation.

## Installing required tools



## Defining directory structure.

## Add automation

### Local

### Github

## Add developer documentation

## Wrap Up!

So far, we have learned how to prepare the environment for a day to day iOS
application development, a set of tools and automation to make life easier
and how to structure the repository aligned with VIPER architecture.

Next will be code some small app to get use!

Happy coding and see you on the next article :)
